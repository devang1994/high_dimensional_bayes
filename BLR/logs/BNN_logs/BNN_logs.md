###BNN with HMC preliminary results

1->20->1

same priors used on both weights

No gibbs sampling to update priors

Unsure about how the uncertainty estimates should be obtained. Following code fragment was used. op_samples has outputs of the neural networks taken over 1000 samples from HMC. The 1000 samples are taken after a 1000 sample burnin. 

    y_sd = np.std(op_samples,axis=0)
