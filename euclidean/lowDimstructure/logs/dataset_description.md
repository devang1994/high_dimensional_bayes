###Dataset with LowD structure

Following meeting with Zoubin, new dataset was generated


x âˆˆ R50 

L= 10x50 matrix, randomly project x into 10 d subspace
each element of L,ie Lij ~ unif[-1,1]


y=||Lx||

The L2 norm of this 

hence we expect the dataset to have a low intrinsic dimensionality 


A 10D parabola in a 50D space 

The **L** used is also pickled for future use
